# wavgenerator
This is a WAV File built from scratch while i was bored with the ability to generate sounds
# Note
the gen.wav file is coming with the repository ,it shows an example of the sine algorithm

# built-in sound generation formulas
* sine (default)
* love graph combined with sine (not recomended because of slow performance)
* Coming soon (probably not)
# How to use
* Make sure you have gcc or any compiler(change Makefile if you do) that supports math
* ```make```
* ```./wav```
* then you'll get an output file called ```gen.wav```
* Enjoy and let me know if you did something interesting (check GH profile for contact methods)
